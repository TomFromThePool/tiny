When you're ready to share your game with the world, the Tiny CLI makes it easy to export your game for web browsers. You can use the `tiny export` command to generate a distributable version of your game that can be published on the web. You can also try the `export` result by using the command `tiny serve`.

Whether you're a seasoned game developer or just getting started, the Tiny CLI is a powerful tool that can help you create, run, develop, and export amazing 2D games with the Tiny engine.
